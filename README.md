# Introduction
This report server service is designed to empower users to create their own report templates using the default AI from Ollama Cloud or those generated by AI assistants with our prompt templates. Users can utilize the prompt templates available in the "Report Template Manager" to customize their Housekeeper Bee Inventory Management System reports. These prompts guide AI assistants (Claude Desktop Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3, Poe GPT-4o-Mini, and Ollama::gpt-oss:120b-cloud) in generating a JSX file, which is then deployed to the template folder of the report server through the "Report Template Manager."

### Disclaimer
This is a proof of concept (PoC) for no-code or low-code solutions using natural language. We do not recommend using JSX report templates from untrusted sources, and we cannot guarantee that malicious code will be detected 100% of the time. You should proceed at your own risk when using this feature.

<br>      

# Installation

1. Git clone the housekeeper bee report server to Linux Desktop *(Housekeeper Bee Server Running on Raspberry Pi 5)*
2. Goto `housekeeper-bee-report-server` folder
3. Goto `setup` folder
4. chmod +x *.sh
5. Run the `setup_report_server.sh` file

It will add a startup file to launch the report server when system boot up. And then you need update the .env file under the backend folder. 

# Setup

### Backend Server
1. Go to the **housekeeper-bee-report-server/src/backend/** folder.
```
cd ~/Desktop/housekeeper-bee-report-server/src/backend
```
2. Copy the .env.template to .env file. 
```
cp .env.templete .env
```
2. Edit the .env file. Replace 192.168.50.102 to your ip and replace the Housekeeper Bee API key to your API key.You can follow the YouTube to get the API key (https://youtu.be/x7zshcqJTlY?si=BaizGb1Abd8uhLla). 



<br>
Replace 192.168.50.102 to your IP.

# Prompt

Prompts can be find from the ***Docs*** folder.

Sample
```

I want you create a very simple report to analysis my storage boxes usage in table format (column includes - #, location name, box name, barcode, number of item, storage items box status)


A. Create a Housekeeper Bee report as a JSX component in CommonJS format.

B. RAW Data structure (Input data) sample:
{
   storageCode: 'ec93960c4a93ea7c5a58163cd6db6fe2',
   storageName: 'Blue box (cables)',
   storageDesc: 'Micro HDMI x 1, C to 3.5mm USB cable x 1, 3.5mm AUX cable x 1, A to charger USB cable x 1',
   storageRemark: '',
   storageStatus: 'Check-In, 75% occupied',
   barcode: '0250208000047',
   storageCreatedDate: '2025-01-27T16:37:52.810+00:00',
   storageModifiedDate: '2025-08-05T07:02:43.283+00:00',
   locationCode: '2f9c0b9731cff1dd83e4b50386732ba2',
   locationName: 'bedroom',
   locationStatus: 'Full',
   familyName: 'My Dream House',
  tags: [ 'cables', 'hdmi', 'electronics', 'audio' ]
}

C. RULES:
- Add the date and time to the top right corner.
- Storage items include: USB Type-A cable, charger, 5 x USB Type-C cables.
- When grouping reports, use the tag field. Tags should be separated by commas (`,` or `，`).
- For storage items, the notation "N x item" or "item x N" indicates quantity (e.g., "3 x Type-C cable" or "Type-C cable x 3" means the total number of Type-C cables is 3). If no multiplier is specified, it counts as 1 item.
- Example of storage item count: 1 + 1 + 5.
- Total storage item count: 7.
- Finally, replace commas (`,` or `，`) in the storage item field with a line break. Add an asterisk (`*`) before each processed storage item.

D. STYLING RULES:
- Use the "styles" object (will be injected by server)
- Available styles: container, header, subtitle, statCard, cardTotal, cardSuccess, cardWarning, cardDanger, cardInfo, statNumber, statLabel, table, tableHeader, th, td, progressBar, bar, bar100, bar75, bar50, bar25, bar0
- Do NOT define the styles object yourself
- Use inline styles: style={styles.container}
- Combine styles: style={{...styles.statCard, ...styles.cardSuccess}}

E. COMPONENT FORMAT:
- Accept props: { data }
- Export as: module.exports = ComponentName
- Use React.createElement or JSX

Embed the code generated in the JSX component to transform the raw JSON data from the RESTful API into the desired report data structure in JSON format.

For example, you call the MCP server tools to retrieve the raw data from Housekeeper Bee. Then, you use this data to transform it into the required report data structure.

F. IMPORTANT: 
- Please embed the code within a JSX component to handle the data structure transformation.
- Do not use useEffect

```

<br>

# Manual start the service

Go to ***housekeeper-report-server*** folder    

Command
```     
npm run prod
```
<br>

# Known Issues

After saving the code as a JSX file for deployment, you need to check for issues that may occasionally occur.

1. *const StorageTagAnalysis = ({ data<font color='#0F0'>, styles </font> }) => {*   
   Sometimes, Claude adds styles at line 2. You should manually remove the <font color="#f00">styles</font>.

2. <font color='#0F0'>*export default StorageBoxReport*</font> should be changed to     
   <font color='#f00'>module.exports = StorageBoxReport;</font>
